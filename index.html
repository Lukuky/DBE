        <h1>Motivation Letter – Master's DBE Specialization</h1>
        <p>My name is Lukáš Hubač, and I will soon be completing my final exams in the Bachelor's program of Web
            Engineering at FIT CTU. In this letter, I would like to express my motivation for applying to the Master’s
            specialization in Digital Business Engineering.</p>
        <p>Throughout my studies, I have been navigating two perspectives. On one hand, I have had a clear long-term
            vision of my future. On the other, I have always stayed open to new opportunities, often feeling unsure of
            where I would be or what I would be doing next year.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this approach, I am now studying my favorite field at the university I have dreamed of attending
            since elementary school while constantly embracing new challenges. Each year, I surprise myself with how
            much I have learned, how often my expectations about the future have shifted, and how many previously
            unknown doors I have managed to open.</p>
        <p>During a leadership course in the Scout movement, I took the 16Personalities test and immediately resonated
            with its slogan: "It’s so incredible to finally be understood." According to the test, I am a Protagonist –
            a thoughtful leader with strong ideals and values, striving to make a positive impact on others.</p>
        <p>In leadership roles, I have found purpose through Scouting and organizing student events. In the IT world, my
            focus has been to absorb as much knowledge and experience as possible so that my future projects can be both
            professional and meaningful.</p>
        <p>One of my core values is to have a positive impact based on my personal beliefs. In the long run, I can only
            envision myself working on purposeful projects that align with those values. And if founding an
            international startup is the best way to achieve that, I will go for it.</p>
        <p>That is why I am so drawn to the Digital Business Engineering specialization. To me, DBE represents the right
            kind of challenge—one that can help me turn my ambitions into reality. I would contradict myself if I did
            not apply. I truly believe I have the right mindset and abilities to make the most of this opportunity and
            to represent the faculty in this field as best I can.</p>
